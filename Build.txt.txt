# BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR DRS LANGUAGE

## Building the Project
1. Create a directory structure for the project:
```
mkdir -p src/com/bayocode
```

2. Copy all the .java files into the src/com/bayocode directory

3. To compile files:
```
javac -d bin src/com/bayocode/*.java
```

4. To run a DRS program:
```
java -cp bin src.com.bayocode.DRS src/com/bayocode/test-files/(filename).drs
```

## Example:
```
java -cp bin src.com.bayocode.DRS src/com/bayocode/test-files/Example1.drs
```

5. To use interactive mode (REPL):
```
java -cp bin src.com.bayocode.DRS
```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any class not found errors, ensure that your classpath is correctly set and that all files have been compiled properly.

Note: The GenerateAst tool is used for development purposes to generate AST classes, but is not required for running the interpreter.
